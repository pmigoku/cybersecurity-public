      Vulnerable function executes `RET` instruction,
      reading the address from the stack.
```

### Step 1: The RET to the Library

- When the vulnerable function executes its RET (return) instruction, it pops the address you overwrote (0xff77aabb) off the stack and into the EIP (Instruction Pointer) register.

- The CPU's execution flow is immediately redirected to that address, which is inside a shared library.

### Step 2: The JMP ESP back to the Stack

- The CPU now executes the instruction at 0xff77aabb, which is JMP ESP.

- This instruction tells the CPU to change EIP again, this time to whatever address the Stack Pointer (ESP) is holding.

- At this exact moment, ESP is pointing to the location on the stack right after the return addressâ€”the start of your NOP sled.

- Execution jumps back to your shellcode on the stack, which then runs.
